        <h3>The woman of faith called Faith</h3>  
          I met a girl on facebook called Faith,<br> Although she's inquisitive but her moral was faint. <br>
          She had gone through a lot and had little faith,<br> but she was open minded to learn and receive like a wide plate. <br><br>
          

          She was ready to rise and started getting courage,<br> she worked during the day and read at night without being discouraged. <br>
          Although her best food ain't portage,<br> but after running to Christ for renewal her life entered a new page. <br><br>
          

          Then she became one of the greatest,<br> she wrote many exams and came out the best. <br>
          because of her great faith  she was always seperated from the rest, <br>
          She became a testimony, the woman who broke herself out of every nest.
